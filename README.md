# EncryptedLoginWebsite
A website with the login and registration procedures secured by a hybrid encryption system.

Hybrid encryption system:
  - Asymmetrical cryptosystem: RSA, with 2048-bit keys (self-implemented in PHP, using just the GMP library);
  - Symmetrical cryptosystem: AES, with a 256-bit private key (not self-implemented).
